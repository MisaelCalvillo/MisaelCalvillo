### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at [Homely](https://homely.mx/). Our mission is to reduce poverty in LATAM by adding software in an industry historically neglected. That industry is cleaning. Have you seen [Rome](https://www.netflix.com/search?q=roma&jbv=80240715) ? That's what we are trying to change and improve.
